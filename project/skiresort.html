It is located in a picturesque mountainous area and offers visitors a wide range of slopes for all levels of fitness.

                <p>For those who are new to alpine skiing, it is also useful to learn about the different types of slopes and their difficulty. For beginner skiers, the "green" slopes are suitable, with the lowest altitude difference, which ensures safe skiing. You should start with easy runs to gradually build up your skills and confidence on the slope. It is important to remember that everyone has their own individual pace of development, so you should not rush and compare yourself to others.</p>
