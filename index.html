                Hey, everybody! My name is Irina Groza, I was born in Washington DC, USA, I live in Russia all my life. I love traveling very much and it's hard for me to stay still). My favorite place is the mountains. I am a fan of skiing. Speed, altitude and fresh wind is what I spend my vacations on. One of my favorite ski resorts is Sochi. It has an amazing combination of mountains and sea! I also love biking and working out at the gym. I like books to think about, my favorite writer is Dostoevsky. I like challenges in life, it keeps me energized. Studying at BYU is such a challenge for me. I am excited to be with you, learning to be persistent and not give up.
